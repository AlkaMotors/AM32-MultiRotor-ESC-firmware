# AM32-MultiRotor-ESC-firmware
Firmware for ARM based speed controllers
<p align="left">
  <a href="/LICENSE"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL--3.0-brightgreen" alt="GitHub license" /></a>
</p>

The AM32 firmware is designed for STM32 ARM processors to control a brushless motor (BLDC).
The firmware is intended to be safe and fast with smooth fast startups and linear throttle. It is meant for use with multiple vehicle types and a flight controller. The firmware can also be built with support for crawlers. For crawler usage please read this wiki page [Crawler Hardware](https://github.com/AlkaMotors/AM32-MultiRotor-ESC-firmware/wiki/Crawler-Hardware-and-AM32)

## Features

AM32 has the following features:

- Firmware upgradable via betaflight passthrough, single wire serial or arduino
- Servo PWM, Dshot(300, 600) motor protocol support
- Bi-directional Dshot
- KISS standard ESC telemetry
- Variable PWM frequency
- Sinusoidal startup mode, which is designed to get larger motors up to speed
## Build instructions
-"make" - builds all targets
-"make AM32_XXX_F051 builds" a speciic target
-Github actions
-Fork project and run the build action within github itself.

## Firmware Release & Configuration Tool

The latest release of the firmware can be found [here](https://github.com/AlkaMotors/AM32-MultiRotor-ESC-firmware/releases/).

To configure AM32 and upload firmware you can use the Multi_ESC config tool using Betaflight passthrough. They can be downloaded from here:

[WINDOWS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qw2f7nM6OZftIE5GTgMPWB5zXCELxYG9/view?usp=sharing),
[LINUX](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QtSKwp3RT6sncPADsPkmdasGqNIk68HH/view?usp=sharing)

Alternately you can use the [Online-ESC Configurator](https://esc-configurator.com/) to flash or change settings with any web browser that supports web serial.



## Hardware
AM32 currently has support for STSPIN32F0, STM32F051, STM32G071, GD32E230, AT32F415 and AT32F421.
The CKS32F051 is not recommended due to too many random issues.
Target compatibility List can be found [here](https://github.com/AlkaMotors/AM32-MultiRotor-ESC-firmware/wiki/List-of-Supported-Hardware) (APR 2021)


## Installation & Bootloader

To use AM32 firmware on a blank ESC, a bootloader must first be installed using an ST-LINK, GD-LINK , CMIS-DAP or AT-LINK.  THe bootloader will be dependant on the MCU used ont he esc . Choose the bootloader that matches the MCU type and signal input pin of the ESC.
The compatibility chart has the bootloader pinouts listed.
Current bootloaders can be found [here](https://github.com/AlkaMotors/AM32_Bootloader_F051/tree/main/Bootloaders).

After the bootloader has been installed the main firmware from can be installed either with the configuration tools and a Betaflight flight controller or a direct connection with a usb serial adapter modified for one wire.

To update an existing AM32 bootloader an update tool can be found [here](https://github.com/AlkaMotors/F051_Bootloader_Updater/releases).

## Formatting
Install clang-format on the development machine then the `format-project.sh` script will work. This is a good idea before PRs to keep code clean.

## Sponsors
